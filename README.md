##### **Estimation of number of spontaneous emissions in a two level atom meassuring stimulated emission in an optical cavity**
##### **Abstract** 
> We estimate the number of spontaneous emissions in a two level atom by measuring stimulated emission in an a driven mode of an optical cavity to which the atom is coupled, considering a dipole constant smaller than the atomic and cavity linewidths. We achieve this by doing a large number of quantum trajectories in which, keeping track of the number of spontaneous emissions and cavity emissions, we manage to get Poisson distributions that relate the probability of obtaining a given number of spontaneous emissions for a fixed number of cavity emissions. Finally we studied the correlations between the number of spontaneous and cavity emissions for a fixed time, and see how this varies with respect the cavity linewidth.
