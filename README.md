#### **Abstract** 
> We estimate the number of spontaneous emissions in a two level atom by measuring stimulated emission in an a driven mode of an optical cavity to which the atom is coupled, considering a dipole constant smaller than the atomic and cavity linewidths. We achieve this by doing a large number of quantum trajectories in which, keeping track of the number of spontaneous emissions and cavity emissions, we manage to get Poisson distributions that relate the probability of obtaining a given number of spontaneous emissions for a fixed number of cavity emissions. Finally, we study the correlations between the number of spontaneous and cavity emissions for a fixed time, and see how this varies with respect the cavity linewidth.

- [Estimation of number of spontaneous emissions in a two level atom beassuring stimulated emission in an optical cavity](https://github.com/gpreisser/Thesis_Project/blob/master/thesis.pdf)
#### Dependencies
- Julia 1.1.0
- PyPlot
- QuantumOptics
#### Jupyter Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook (Julia 1.1.0 Kernel) is added to illustrate the workflow. 
- There is a script *Probability Distributions.ypynb* in which there is the code to obtain the probability distributions to obtain certain number of spontaneous emissions for a fixed number of cavity emissions.
- There is another script *Data Exploration.ipynb* in which we analyse the data and graph different values related to the mean, standard deviation and variance.
