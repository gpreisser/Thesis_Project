#### **Estimation of number of spontaneous emissions in a two level atom meassuring stimulated emission in an optical cavity**
***
#### **Abstract** 
> We consider a driven Jaynes-Cummings system under weak coupling, which interacts with the environment through emissions from the atom and emissions that leak through one of the lateral cavity mirrors.  We fix the parameters of the model in order to stablish a dynamic in which the number of photons in the leaky cavity remain constant and, using quantum trajectory theory, we estimate the number of spontaneous emissions in the two-level atom – which will be measured from the upper side of the cavity – by measuring emissions that leak through one of the semi-transparent cavity mirrors. Studying the system further we find that the cavity generates a correlation between the emissions from the two sources.

#### Dependencies
- Julia 1.1.0
- PyPlot
- QuantumOptics
#### Jupyter Notebook
A Jupyter Notebook (Julia 1.1.0 Kernel) is added to illustrate the workflow. 
- There is a script `Probability Distributions.ipynb` in which there is the code to obtain the probability distributions to obtain certain number of spontaneous emissions for a fixed number of cavity emissions.
- There is another script `Data Exploration.ipynb` in which we analyse the data and graph different values related to the mean, standard deviation and variance. 

More details about the work can be found in the written thesis `thesis.pdf`, as well as in the research article based on the thesis work `paper1.2.1.pdf`.
